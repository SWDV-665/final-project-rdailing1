# final-project-rdailing1

This is a companion application for the Gift Exchange Organizer web app created for the final project in the capstone class.

Rather than using MongoDB, the database used for this app is the same SQL database used for the companion app.

Usage:
open a command window
cd to geo-server folder
execute 'node server.js'

open a second command window
cd to geomobile folder
execute 'ionic serve --type=angular'

The app opens to the login page.  Use the default username and password.  cmdail@earthlink.net can also be used, with the same password.
Once signed in, click 'Select Group' and choose a group to view.  If a partner has been chosen, that person's wishlist info will be displayed.
